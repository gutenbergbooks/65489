<p>The growth of the thing in his mind had been gradual. When it had obtruded
upon his consciousness at first he had drawn back in mingled fear and anger. By
degrees, however, he tolerated the thought, only always at a distance, and
concluded by allowing it to make a rendezvous of his idle meditations, receiving
it much as one might welcome an unwholesome but highly fascinating acquaintance.
All the time he knew its real name was Theft.</p>

<p>For three years Parsly had served as station agent and telegraph-operator at
the Junction. Each day he had observed the transient bustling by the long
platform, the spectacle never varying. Long vestibuled trains halted
impatiently, and always the same curious or apathetic faces peered out at him
from the Pullmans.</p>

<p>It was the branch line, tapping the lumber country, that contributed
humanism, consisting of a nodding acquaintance with timber operators and forlorn
commercial travelers. The first were always in a hurry to make the big city
connection; the latter lingered in his company for the sake of gaining an
audience while they cursed the country.</p>

<p>The last because the Junction was not the liveliest place in the world to put
in an hour or two of waiting. Situated where the engineering problem had been
the simplest, it was surrounded by blueberry plains, dotted at intervals with
scrub pine. As the locomotives annually set the pines afire, the immediate
foreground continuously presented a dead, charred appearance. Far-off, the
objective point of the Pullmans, loomed the cool silhouettes of mountains,
guardians of inland lakes and famous fishing.</p>

<p>More than once Parsly compared himself with Robinson Crusoe in his isolation;
only he had no man Friday to enliven his dull routine. He saw much of the
passing world but was never of it. Thus, at the end of three years, the hurrying
by of the heavy trains aroused a species of resentment. Everyone was at liberty
to take flight but him. Then again, fifty dollars a month for his combined
duties was hardly a compensating solace.</p>

<p>It was the matter of salary that caused the idea to germinate while he was
sullenly working the semaphore one day. He had just received from the night
branch some four hundred dollars express money which he must deliver to the
agent on the morning city-passenger. Having just received his monthly wages he
could not help but contrast its meager total with the bulking roll in his
hip-pocket.</p>

<p>If he had four hundred dollars, all his own, he would throw up the job and
use it in one delicious round of travel. By the time it was exhausted he could
obtain another position in a pleasing environment. In logical sequence he
decided he might as well allow his imagination a wider range and play at taking
a vacation with the largest sum ever entrusted to his care for a single night.
He remembered this to be an even thousand dollars, sent down by a big operator
in payment for horses in the lumber camps.</p>

<p>A thousand dollars offered his fancy vastly more possibilities to work with.
The four hundred became insignificant. As his duties permitted him much time for
reflection, he carried the thought back to his dingy office and entertained it
by consulting maps in the railroad folders. In this fashion he took a hurried
excursion across the continent and spied out the land. Then he became critical
and weighed and balanced different localities.</p>

<p>The Southwest, free from cold, gray Autumnal rains, howling snows and Spring
inundations, finally appealed to him as being ideal. Of course, there might be
two thousand dollars entrusted to him any night, especially now that it was
Autumn and the lumbermen were stocking up for the Winter campaign.</p>

<p>It was at that precise point that his cheek reddened and he felt a touch of
alarm as he angrily told himself such imagining was immoral, for it was based on
the suggestion that he steal the money. He condemned the suggestion wrathfully
as he walked a quarter of a mile to the lonely home where he boarded, and yet he
was more downcast than ever over his colorless place in life.</p>

<p>On returning to the station to close up for the night, which meant a weary
wait for the up-passenger to pull in, he returned to the suggestion abruptly and
recklessly. It was the sight of the porters making up the berths, the
comradeship in the smoking compartment, that plunged him into full revolt; only
now he proceeded on the theory the money was legitimately his.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ve earned it. What if I should take it, providing I could
get away with it? How would I spend it?”</p>

<p>This surrender eased him much. Of course he wouldn’t take it, not a penny;
but it’s impossible to picture a career of spending until the imagination has
logically furnished the requisite possession. Now he had mentally satisfied his
imagination as to possession, although the technique was illegal. Fortunately
there is no law punishing a man for inwardly discussing the possible assets of a
crime.</p>

<p>Of course, Parsly merely intended to pursue his day-dreams unhampered by any
irritating self-criticism. He had systematically arranged his data and could
spend a million a day, should he choose. That was where he erred. His
imagination became a hard taskmaster, very exacting. Once he accepted the
suggestion that the money was to come to him through theft, his methodical mind
insisted on reviewing the possibilities of detection before permitting him to
enjoy the fruits.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you be caught and arrested before you could make a beginning?” was
the cautious query he was forced to put to himself.</p>

<p>Such nagging is very annoying, and to satisfy his mysterious Pyrrhonist and
continue with his Spanish architecture, he set himself about planning how the
trick could be done without his being detected.</p>

<p>This was a hopeless morass at first, and very unpleasant; for instead of
picturing innocent expenditures he found himself sweating and struggling with
the problem of how he could keep the money once he secured it. The more he
labored the more nimble became his other self in raising pertinent objections,
exploding seemingly sound theories and ridiculing his most astute
hypotheses.</p>

<p>To merely appropriate the money and disappear was quickly shown to be the
height of idiocy. That spelled a life of slinking and fear, the flying from
phantoms. It took some thought to clear the foreground of discarded theories and
plans and approach the realm of finesse; but at last he seemed to be building on
a firmer foundation.</p>

<p>Probably the frequent raids by yeggmen on rural post-offices and isolated
railroad stations stimulated this office of his imagination. For in reading the
paper, presented him gratis each evening by the newsboy on the up-passenger, he
noted the yeggmen always securely tied whoever stood between them and loot, cut
the tell-tale wires and escaped.</p>

<p>Then came the great idea; and slapping the paper he glanced apprehensively
around the small office, and whispered:</p>

<p>“If I faked a holdup the yeggs would get the credit and I’d get the dough. It
would be a cinch, if a man wanted to play crooked.”</p>

<p>Stay! Was it so easy? The various precautions necessary for counterfeiting a
robbery, each simple in itself, quickly loomed into mountains. Then he derided
on just how the furniture should be broken and overturned to approximate
realism; just when the wires should be cut; whether the station door should be
left open or closed, and the condition of his clothing and pockets. As there was
no safe in the office the agent carried the moneys upon his person. At first he
imagined his pockets turned inside out, then repudiated the thought as being too
clumsy.</p>

<p>But what about the tying-up portion of the programme? Could a man tie himself
so as to convince his rescuers that his predicament was genuine? Of course,
there was a chance, rather a good one, too, of his landlord, foreman of the
section crew, coming to his aid and cutting the cords without making any
particular observations. Still, only perfection of detail would satisfy his
exacting critic.</p>

<p>Now, Parsly, if slow of thought at times, was dogged in his persistence once
he grappled with a problem. He now gave his spare time to studying ropes and
knots.</p>

<p>The newspapers had charged up the various robberies to Fresno Red and his
gang, and had dwelt at length on the method used in each case in tying up
watchman or agent. Invariably one end of the rope was made fast about the feet
and ankles of the captive, then parsed up and around the waist, the hands being
caught and tied behind the back; the loose end finally being made fast about the
captive’s neck in a slip-noose.</p>

<p>It was done very quickly, each victim had averred, and so hampered a man that
the more he struggled the more he endangered his life by self-strangulation. It
was a method worthy of the redoubtable Fresno Red, and one Parsly now attacked
to satisfy his insistence on correct detail.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>That night he surreptitiously carried a piece of new rope home. He had
already discovered that new rope would not slip like old, smoothly worn rope. In
the secrecy of his small chamber he essayed the simple task of tying his own
feet. His heart beat rapidly as he pulled the knot tight; then he laughed
vacuously and told himself it was all a game. It ended where it began, merely a
pastime. He did not attempt to duplicate the yeggmen’s knots further that
night.</p>

<p>He would not concede that he stood in fear of the trooping suggestions now
besetting him and eagerly offering aid. Yet he fought hard to put the thoughts
from his mind during the morning hours and felt extremely virtuous as he handed
the down agent the customary parcel of money.</p>

<p>That night he relaxed and deftly tied his feet, passed the line about his
waist and clumsily wound it around his wrists. He remained awake more than an
hour trying to solve the rest of the problem&mdash;how to fasten the rope about his
wrists so it would be impossible to free himself and then secure the end about
his neck. He decided it couldn’t be done, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Toward morning, when but half awake, he heard a voice advise&mdash;</p>

<p>“Tie the rope first about the neck.”</p>

<p>He popped up to a sitting posture and stared wildly about the dark chamber.
He knew it was a suggestion from his inner self, yet so distinctly did he hear
the words it seemed as if they must have been voiced aloud. Throughout the early
morning he brooded over the suggestion. At first he could not discern any sense
in it. Subconsciously, however, he had often noticed the lumberman’s trick of
using a dove-hitch&mdash;two half-hitches&mdash;and gradually the recollection thrust itself
above the threshold of consciousness. He believed he had succeeded.</p>

<p>He must make the rope fast about his neck while standing, then secure it
about his ankles with practically no slack, continuing the loose end to his
waist and tying it, taking care to have it pass outside the rope running from
neck to heels. Then by throwing back his head and heels he would obtain enough
slack to make the two double loops, or half-hitches, through which he could work
his wrists.</p>

<p>The last operation, he realized, would demand great care, as he must thrust
his hands in from opposite directions until wrist overlapped wrist. If it would
work he would dismiss the matter and resume the pleasing visions of spending the
money.</p>

<p>The morning’s paper contained a glaring account of a daring yegg robbery at
the Centerville station. The agent had been trussed up and some fifteen hundred
dollars taken.</p>

<p>“Those guys certainly got the nerve,” commented the newsboy as the agent was
reading the item. “Didn’t even gag Roberts. Just corded him up like a bale of
hay, copped his roll and beat it. Roberts is so scared he’s working his
notice.”</p>

<p>That afternoon Parsly was curious to examine all baggage fastened with ropes.
Several parcels of sample dowels, sent by express from the up-country mill, held
his attention the closest. They were tied with new rope and the dove-hitch held
tightly, even when he worked an end loose. Just before he closed up for supper
the branch train brought in a hundred-odd dollars, but the agent confidentially
assured:</p>

<p>“Tomorrer’ll be a record breaker. Two parties I know of are going to send
down a thousand per. Together with the other money you’ll have close to three
thousand bones to nurse over night. The danged company ought to put a safe in
your office.”</p>

<p>Off duty for the night, he hastened to his room where the supreme test
awaited him. If he succeeded there was nothing to prevent a man from robbing
himself and leaving no clues. When from the open door he could catch the sound
of his landlord’s heavy, regular breathing, he removed his shoes, seated himself
on the edge of the bed, and began experimenting with the cord.</p>

<p>He fastened the noose about his neck and stood up and noted where the rope in
a direct line touched the floor. Then seating himself he tied it tightly about
his ankles and brought the loose end up to and around his waist. There was
scarcely any slack when he straightened out his legs. At first he feared he had
drawn the cord too tight and, anxiously turning on his face, threw back his head
and heels.</p>

<p>With a thrill of elation he found the slack would enable him, by an effort,
to form the hitch. After a moment’s fumbling he succeeded, and even wriggled his
hands through the loops until the tips of the fingers rested on the upper
forearm. It wearied him, and with a sigh of physical relief he extended his
legs.</p>

<p>In an instant his tongue felt too large for his mouth, and with a gasp of
horror he decided he was choking to death. He did not lose his nerve as he
remembered the remedy, and he drew back his legs. But although this gave a bit
of slack to the rope he could not induce the hitch to loosen. From the
satisfaction of having proven his theory he quickly glided into the fear that he
had calculated too nicely.</p>

<p>Had the rope been old and smooth, or had his hands been imprisoned palm to
palm, finger tip to fingertip, he might have secured a leverage and by working
them apart have succeeded in wrenching one free. But the new rope refused to
give, and for a minute he lay quiet, panting for breath, and taking great care
to bring no strain on his neck.</p>

<p>Down-stairs the old clock was ponderously ticking off the seconds; and he
remained a prisoner. His heart chilled as he feared he must summon the foreman
to come to his rescue. But how could he explain his peculiar plight? What
suspicions might not his predicament arouse?</p>

<p>This dread quickly gave way before one more chance. The noose seemed to be
tightening about his neck, and he remembered the foreman was a heavy sleeper.
His wife occupied a room with her small children at the other end of the house.
He doubted his ability to call help; if he did not he might slowly strangle to
death.</p>

<p>Already the cold sweat was trickling into his eyes and it required a mighty
effort of the will to restrain himself from thrashing about. He knew, however,
that the moment he lost control of his nerves and moved incautiously his wind
would be shut off. Gritting his teeth he drew his heels far back like an
acrobat. He was lying face down with the bedclothes half smothering him. Then he
gently picked at the rope with his finger tips. Useless. The cords held his
wrists like bands of iron.</p>

<p>Finally he managed to work the cord between the fingers of his left hand and
exert a pressure upward, hoping to loosen the hitch. His essay was barren of
results for some moments, and it was not until he was about to collapse that he
felt his right hand moving more freely. With an inarticulate cry of triumph he
wrenched his wrist smartly, and instantly felt the cord renew its grip like a
sentient thing. It was like a cat playing with a mouse.</p>

<p>Breathing in dry sobs he slowly sought to recover the lost ground and
persevered until he again was pushing upward on the cord. For the second time he
felt the right hand move a bit; this time he worked it back and forth most
gently and at last managed to pull it free. Even then it required some minutes
to remove the rope from his throat.</p>

<p>“&#x2E3A; the thing!” he choked, sinking back exhausted. “It nearly got me!”</p>

<p>That night he dreamed of the money brought in by the branch train; only there
were cars and cars loaded with it, and it was all in gold, and men were removing
it with huge scoops, just as they shovel out yellow corn.</p>

<p>By morning he had regained his normal tone and even felt inclined to laugh at
himself. After all, had he not done what he set out to accomplish&mdash;to prove a man
could effectually make himself a prisoner? Had he been engaged in a <em>bona
fide</em> robbery he would not have attempted to free himself. His success in
escaping detection would be his utter inability to do so. In that case, of
course, he would expect to endure the torture till help reached him.</p>

<p>What odds if a man suffered a few hours of physical agony, if it resulted in
supplying him with several thousand dollars? He now clearly appreciated that had
his experiment been less successful he would have been grievously disappointed;
the problem would have remained an obstacle to his imagination, and his
dangerous, although alluring, fancies needs must be postponed. On the whole he
felt rather proud of his achievement.</p>

<p>All day the great idea kept pounding through his head. He had it in his power
to obtain more than two thousand, possibly three thousand, dollars without being
suspected. His temples throbbed and ached as the thought assailed him. Once or
twice during the afternoon he was called to the baggage-room to check a trunk.
Each time his gaze involuntarily sought the coil of new rope hanging behind the
door.</p>

<p>It was well known to students of crime that yeggmen pick up their tools on
the premises of the place robbed, traveling unhampered by the burglar’s usual
outfit. How natural that they should appropriate a piece of this very cord to
bind him with! That would necessitate the shattering of the lock, but the door
was old and weak and a well-delivered kick would smash it loose. He had no
appetite for supper and heard but little of the foreman’s gossip.</p>

<p>“I was saying I’d like to play you a game of crib tonight if you feel in
trim,” repeated the foreman.</p>

<p>“Crib? Oh, of course. Sure, Danny. I’ll play crib. I’ll be home right after
the up-train pulls out. I’ll be home in good season,” eagerly promised Parsly,
suddenly realizing the foreman might get impatient waiting, might take alarm at
his boarder failure to reach home, and go in search of him. That would eliminate
long, slow hours of torture on the office floor.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll be home right after the nine-o’clock goes up,” he said. “I won’t
keep you waiting.”</p>

<p>While returning through the woods it suddenly came home to him that he had
planned to steal the money. For a moment he felt strongly moved and made a
feeble pretense of denying the accusation. Then with a drawn face he
muttered:</p>

<p>“&#x2E3A; it! Why sidestep? It’s been in my nut for days. I’ll never get another
chance like this&mdash;so much dough and the yeggs near.”</p>

<p>He sought to distract his mind by bitterly assailing the railroad and express
companies and assuring himself the thought would never have occurred to him had
he been paid something beyond a starvation wage for a fourteen-hour day. It
really wasn’t robbery. Laws were made by men. It was reprisal. When it came to
the ethics of it&mdash;only Parsly didn’t know what the word meant&mdash;he’d earned the
money, at least a part of it.</p>

<p>The night connived at his purpose, blowing up cold and desolate and on the
verge of a storm. By the time the branch pulled in, the platform was streaming
rivulets from the heavy downpour, and the express agent made the office on the
run.</p>

<p>“Here’s the stuff!” he yelped, tossing a package on the table. “Nothing to
hold us and we’re going right back. So long.” Parsly breathed more freely.
Sometimes a mixup over freight, or a hot-box, kept the train, with the men
careless of the passing minutes, as they had no schedule to make on the return
run to Waverly, the first station, where they would hold the siding for the
night.</p>

<p>Outside, the rain was falling with a thunderous clamor, smearing the window
panes till it was impossible to make out the switch-lights directly in front of
the station. Parsly rose, his eyes glittering. The money must be concealed
safely till the morrow.</p>

<p>He had never read Poe’s story of the purloined letter, yet instinct urged a
simple hiding-place. He decided on the greasy canvas coat, hung back of the
door. He wore it only when cleaning the switch-lamps. The package fitted nicely
into one capacious pocket. No one would ever find it there. Now to arrange the
stage settings, the overturned furniture, the open door&mdash;</p>

<p>The door opened. Four men were crowding in through the miniature waterfall
released from the loaded eaves. Parsly eyed them as one entranced, his gaze
frozen with horror. It was no physical fear he dreaded, but for the moment it
seemed as if his evil purpose had escaped him and now stood crystallized into
tangible shapes, each a unit of wickedness.</p>

<p>“Nail the mutt!” sharply ordered the leader, a man with a heavy shock of red
hair.</p>

<p>One of the men twisted Parsly’s arm behind him and thrust an iron wrist under
his chin. Two others stood near, one holding a revolver, the other caressing a
“life-preserver.” The leader was glancing about the office.</p>

<p>All this occurred in a single motion, yet it seemed to cover ages to the
stupefied agent. It was the red-headed man’s prowling gaze that brought Parsly
to his senses. They were yeggmen&mdash;Fresno Red and his gang. They were after the
money and the leader was seeking the safe.</p>

<p>The man who had seized the agent was deciding he had never in all of his
strong-arm jobs encountered so thoroughly frightened a victim as now, when
Parsly’s chin hugged in and his strong teeth bit deeply into his captor’s wrist,
causing him to scream with pain. At the same instant, the agent’s long leg
kicked out, overturning the table and the one lamp.</p>

<p>The room was plunged in darkness and the man with the revolver discharged his
weapon, evoking a shriek of mortal agony, but not from the agent. Fresno Red
called loudly for a light while he attempted to strike a match. Parsly had the
advantage; he knew one of the robbers was dead or seriously wounded, and while
every man was his enemy in the darkness, the yeggmen feared to injure a pal.</p>

<p>“Block the door and window!” roared Fresno Red.</p>

<p>During this brief leeway Parsly’s groping hands found, the office stool and
he swung it around his head in a deadly circle. By the sickening crunch he knew
at least one of the enemy was off the active list. Then a match flared up for a
second and the leader’s revolver exploded, the agent experiencing a stinging
sensation in the side.</p>

<p>For an instant Parsly felt strangely numb; then the stool rose like a flail
and the man with the “life-preserver” sank to the floor.</p>

<p>Somehow the agent now felt a riotous elation. Fear was a very distant
emotion. His veins were filled with molten lead instead of blood. He breathed
hate rather than the smoky air. It was a monstrous thing that these murderers
should seek to rob his employers.</p>

<p>With a wild howl of rage he plunged into the remaining two men, lucking and
smashing like a maniac with the fragment of the stool. Out through the door they
poured, another of the gang falling with a fractured skull. Then Parsly
discovered he was alone.</p>

<p>He stood stupidly for a few moments, weaving back and forth. He aroused
himself as his dull ears caught a familiar sound. A hand-car was being pumped
down the grade. His mind cleared to supernormal lucidity. He saw his advantage.
He had been brutally attacked and seriously wounded. The one man escaping would
be charged with having stolen the money; they wrested it from him in the
struggle. He had fought hard; he’d earned it. And yet, should he pull the lever
close by his right hand, he could throw open the switch down the line and send
Fresno Red crashing into the empty coal-cars on the siding.</p>

<p>“You’ll never get a better chance! It simply can’t be known and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No!” he yelled, springing to the lever and pulling it back with his last
ounce of strength.</p>

<p>“No, &#x2E3A; you! No!”</p>

<p>Within the next minute he heard a dull crash and knew the yegg leader had
collided with the coal-cars. Then he concluded the wet platform would be an
ideal place for a red-hot body to rest on.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>“For the love of Mike! Parsly down and out! One man groaning and another dead
in the office, one stiff out here! Good Heavens!” exclaimed the horrified
foreman as he held up the lantern. He had come because Parsly had failed to keep
his promise as to the game of cribbage.</p>

<p>As he read the full story in the four prostrate forms he collected his wits
and dragged Parsly into the office, meanwhile begging him to “Wake up,” and “Get
back his nerve.”</p>

<p>“What’s the row?” feebly asked Parsly. Then he remembered.</p>

<p>“I’ve been shot. Find the instrument and see if the wires are O. K. Hold me
up where I can reach it. I must send in the alarm. The leader is down on the
siding somewhere. I shunted him off into the empties.”</p>

<p>“The desperate devils was going to make sure,” panted the foreman as he
hunted for the instrument. “They fetched two coils of rope.”</p>

<p>The papers made a great hero of Parsly. Fresno Red, who was found with a
broken shoulder, gave him a brave record for being game. The railroad sent a
superintendent to tell him he was in line for promotion and the express company
guardedly considered presenting him with a reward.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any money,” growled Parsly as the agent sat by his bed in the
little house.</p>

<p>“Cut that out. I did nothing but what’s in the day’s work. But I’d like the
Centerville job. Roberts, they say, is going to quit. That pays a hundred a
month.”</p>

<p>He was appointed two days later. Only now he hates the sight of coiled rope
and looks upon express money as so much junk.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
